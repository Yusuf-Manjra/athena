<h1>ATLAS MLC (Multilanguage Committee) Recommendations</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The MLC has reached a concensus on the following recommendations :
<ol>
<li>The ATLAS experiment should unambiguously support a "restricted"
  multi-language policy for its software.   By that we mean that,
  at the moment (see footnote a), we suggest three languages, i.e.
  C++, Java and Fortran90/95, and only those three, to be officially
  accepted as development languages inside well encapsulated modules.
  For this to work, one will have to enforce a genuine modularity which
  is in any case highly desirable.</li>
<li>For the general framework (now in C++) that has the essential task of
  defining the interfaces between modules (see footnote b), we
  recommend a move to Java.  We are aware of the very important
  implications of this recommendation but see it as highly desirable
  for the future. We recommend that work should begin as soon as
  possible so as not to jeopardise this move.</li>
<li>In view of the present situation, we recommend that this framework
  support C++ interfaces on top of the Java ones.  F90 modules (mainly
  algorithmic ones) should also be supported but the framework itself
  will not provide direct F90 interfaces. The responsibility for
  providing adapters from the native framework Java (or C++) interfaces
  to F90 should be on the F90 developers themselves. However, everything
  should be done to keep these interfaces as simple as possible and to
  avoid them to use too language dependent features.  In particular, all
  "public" objects, i.e. the objects being exchanged between modules,
  should be uniquely identifiable using (as much as possible) language
  independent identifiers.</li>
<li>For the present modules in F77 or Age, we recommend them to be
  progressively replaced by new modules in one of the three
  above-mentioned languages or, at least, to be adapted to the F90
  compilers.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
We feel that these recommendations best match the strengths of the
languages, compatibility with the existing developments and the sociology
of the ATLAS experiment.  They could also lead to offer the best
environment for integration with other tools (e.g. GRID, physics analysis
and visualization).

<dd>a) As time pass, new languages will appear and some of them
        may be accepted after proper evaluation.</dd>
<dd>b) The "clients" of these interfaces are, in our mind, Atlas
        physicists or groups of physicists or whole labs that want
        to contribute to the Atlas software by providing
	algorithms for simulation or reconstruction or analysis
        of data.</dd>
