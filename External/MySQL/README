This is the MySQL pseudopackage for the real external MySQL package. 
Its purpose is to allow simulation developers to work in the ATLAS 
cvs/cmt environment.

The actual  MySQL package provides:
1) the MySQL client libraries needed to connect to the MySQL database server.
   These are in the acrhitecture dependent directory lib
2) the MySQL header files needed by the client code.
   These are in the acrhitecture dependent directory inlcude
3) the MySQL client executable usefull for debugging purposes mostly to
   check if the connection to the server can be established from the particular
   host. It is in the acrhitecture dependent directory bin and preferrably
   a static executable.
4) the MySQL architechture-independent directory share providing
   share/language/errmsg.sys needed for the MySQL embedded server library.

The real external MySQL package is typically made by installing the
libraries downloaded from the www.mysql.com

The redhat version independent static libraries/executables are, e.g.,
from the mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz

The RedHat version-dependent shared libaries are from the
MySQL-shared-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm.
These libraries are independent of the gcc compiler version, but they are
not good for the rh61, since they require libc.so.6 (from GLIBC_2.2) which is
not installed at CERN rh61 machines.
For RedHat 6.1 one must then use the static libraries or use the
older MySQL versions of shared libraries.

There is no dependencies on other packages.

Some RedHat-specific notes below:

To enable the compressed communication protocol between the server and the client
MySQL requires the non-system libz.so usually found in the  /usr/lib
This library is a part of the zlib.rpm which is usually installed as a part
of RedHat distribution.

To enable the multithreaded clients MySQL provides the libmysqlclient_r.so
that requires libpthread.so (from GLIBC_2.2) which is the part of glibc.rpm.
