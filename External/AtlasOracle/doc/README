This is the Oracle pseudopackage for the real external Oracle Instant Client
package. It's purpose is to allow software developers to work in the ATLAS 
cvs/cmt environment.

The Oracle Instant Client package is different from the standard Oracle Client
area. It is different in terms of the package license required for distribution.
(See http://otn.oracle.com/tech/oci/instantclient/instantclient.html)
Other benefits of Instant Client are:

    * Installation involves copying a small number of files.
    * The Oracle client-side number of required files and the total disk storage
      are significantly reduced.
    * There is no loss of functionality or performance for applications deployed
      in Instant Client mode.
    * It simplifies packaging ATLAS software distribution kits.

The installed Oracle Instant Client package provides:
1) Oracle client libraries needed to connect to the Oracle database server.
   These are in the acrhitecture dependent directory lib
2) Oracle header files needed by the client code.
   These are in the acrhitecture dependent directory rdbms/public.
3) Oracle client executable usefull for debugging purposes mostly to
   check if the connection to the server can be established from the
   particular host. It is in the acrhitecture dependent directory bin.
3) JDBC driver for Oracle needed for ATLAS Java database access tools.

The real external Oracle Instant Client package is installed by the IT/DB
group (http://wwwdb.web.cern.ch/wwwdb/oracle-client-CERN.html)

The linux shared libraries are platform and compiler dependent.
