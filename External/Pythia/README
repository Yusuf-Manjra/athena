This is the Pythia pseudopackage for the real external Pythia package. 
Its purpose is to allow simulation developers to work in the ATLAS cvs/srt environment.

Only the CMT version is being maintained as of Sept 2001. only the cmt/requiremens file is used


This package is enabled only on Linux and Solaris, the reason being that 
Pythia use native STL on Linux and ObjectSpace everywhere else, whereas 
ATLAS offline use native STL everywhere except for Solaris. 

The default implementation assumes that the Pythia installation directory 
is at CERN under /afs/cern.ch/atlas/offline/external/pythia and sets
PYTHIAINSTALL=/afs/cern.ch/atlas/offline/external/Pythia/pro

This can be overriden by the user, who can run `make PYTHIAINSTALL=foo', 
foo being his local institute installation for example.

All Pythia include paths (PYTHIAFLAGS) 
are available. 
also become available. For details please browse the Pythia.mk.in file 
in this directory.
The necessary libraries are linked using the dependencies found recursively 
under the user $(top_srcdir)/.srt/$(SRT_TARGET) directory.

Examples on how to use the Pythia pseudopackage  will be available later
