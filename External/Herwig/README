This is the Herwig pseudopackage for the real external Herwig package. 
Its purpose is to allow simulation developers to work in the ATLAS 
cvs/srt environment.

This package is enabled only on Linux and Solaris, the reason being that 
Herwig use native STL on Linux and ObjectSpace everywhere else, whereas 
ATLAS offline use native STL everywhere except for Solaris. 

The default implementation assumes that the Herwig installation directory 
is at CERN under /afs/cern.ch/atlas/offline/external/Herwig and sets
HERWIGINSTALL=/afs/cern.ch/atlas/offline/external/Herwig/pro

This can be overriden by the user, who can run `make HERWIGINSTALL=foo', 
foo being his local institute installation for example.

The necessary libraries are linked using the dependencies found recursively 
under the user $(top_srcdir)/.srt/$(SRT_TARGET) directory.

Examples on how to use the Herwig pseudopackage  will be available later
