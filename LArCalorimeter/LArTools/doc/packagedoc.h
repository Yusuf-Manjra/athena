@section LArTools_SignalMap Signal channel cabling mapping

LArCablingService (an AlgTool) provides the cabling mapping for signal channels, between online and offline identifiers.
LArCablingService will be removed, LArCablingLegacyService will be provided for clients which should retire soon

It also provide the definition of LArReadoutModuleID (defined in LArIdentifier package), and the mapping from FEB ID to 
the backend readout module.

the data classes LArOnOffIdMap and LArFebRodMap are conditions data objects, and can be filled from database.

LArFebRod_P and LArOnOffId_P are persistent data structure.

@section LArTools_HVMap HV channel mapping

LArHVCablingTool provides the mapping between the HV channel and the detector electrode.,
It is also responsbile for encoding and decoding the LArHVCellID and LArHVDetectorID and LArHVElectrodeID.

LArHVMap is a data class that contains the mapping.
