// LArVCalculator.hh 
// Prepared 27-Jun-2001 Bill Seligman

// This is an abstract base for a geometry calculator for ATLAS EM
// detectors.

// A "calculator" is used in much the same way as a hand-held
// calculator might be.  The user supplies a value and hits 'Enter'
// (i.e., invokes the Process() method).  Then they read off whatever
// values are of interest.

// 12-Jul-2002 WGS: Added access method to return an identifier.  This
// replaces any other access methods for hit ID information.

// 09-Jan-2002 WGS: Major modification -- The main calculation method
// FindCell(G4ThreeVector&) has been changed to Process(G4Step*).  The
// reason for this change is that it became apparent the calculators
// needed more information than just the point of the energy deposit.

// Also: since this class may also be used by the HEC, changed its
// named from LArVEMCalculator to LArVCalculator.
