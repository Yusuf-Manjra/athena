1) You first need to generate all data files. To do so, run

python GenerateHVDatFiles

All previous files will be erased. If you only want to append the data for new plots, run

python GenerateHVDatFiles #startID

where #startID is a tripID to start with. The tool will delete no files and only append new ones.

2) You might want to generate all plots as well. To do so, run

python GenerateAllPlots.py

Previous plots will be deleted.

3) To (re)create only one plot, run

python GenerateAllPlots.py #tripID
