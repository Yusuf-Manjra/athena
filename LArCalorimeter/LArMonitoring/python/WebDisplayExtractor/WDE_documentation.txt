WebDisplayExtractor (WDE) version 3:

Original single python file written by Matthieu Plamondon now divided into 6 files based on functionality.  
A folder with a version 3_0, 3_1, etc is found here: /afs/cern.ch/user/l/larmon/public/WebDisplayExtractor/WDE_files_* and contains a production version of the following files:
	
	index_cm.py  main class (the webpage points to file /afs/cern.ch/user/l/larmon/public/WebDisplayExtractor/index.py which is a soft link to the current version of index_cm.py) calls the selection based on user input calls run_report or  noisycells with the requested values.
	selection.py - handles the input for run number, report type, express/bulk and expert options, also contains the AddReportButton function
	run_report.py  main function to fill the Run report table
	noisycells.py  main function to analyse the noisy cells
	print_rows.py  prints out the rows of interesting clusters/cells for the noisycells report
	print_top.py  contains the code for the top of the noisycells table
	Also in this folder are two unchanged backup files (index_Rel17_backup.py  the former Release 17 version of the WDE and scripts_backup.js  the java scripts used with the python)

WDE_files_dev contains the development version of each file.  

The following developments have been implemented at the same time as the splitting of into sub-files:
1.	Remove Multiple Runs
2.	Change version notation
3.	Collision Lumi Blocks moved to renamed LAr Global column
4.	Some superficial changes: bolding, capitalization, etc….
5.	New row for stream used or stream invalid
6.	Three new columns for the run report:
	a.	Noise Bursts (LArNoisyRO-q factor) - Noise bursts in the LAr Global column and the Noise Burst (Energy) column will be retained for cross-checks
	b.	DSP computation - Check if Eoffline != Eonline with precision for FEBs in each partition (# of FEBs/LBs
	c.	Timing  Checking for each layer that the mean time is not outside the accepted interval
7.	Options simplified for shifters:
	a.	Choosing the run number and report type sets Data stream and processing version options automatically in most cases
	b.	LADIeS express (express), LADIeS bulk (JetTauEtmiss), or Use Expert Options
	c.	Run Report and NoisyLArCells (CosmicCalo)
	d.	All options still available on Expert Option menu



Changes to WDE between v3.4 and v3.5:

--Proper extraction of the proc version derived from the AMI tag using DQMF function get_next_proc_pass
--run_spec[“high_run”] variable set always to be the same as low_run
Run Report:
--Link to “Timeline” in column 1 is removed and replaced by link to “DQ logbook”
--Wording is changed for clarity from “DQ web” to “Tier 0 Webdisplay” also in column 1
--Correct the Athena software version setup for the retrieval of red LBs from DCS (from 16.0.1 to 17.2.1.1)
--replacement of HVNONNOMINAL by HVNONNOMINAL_CORRECTED for the bulk when there is trip of a new module
NoisyCells:
--new flag for noisy LArCells not associated to a cluster but with a green number in CaloCells column (if pink number(Percentage of Qfactor >4000) >80% : sporadicBurstNoise; if <80% : highNoiseHG)
--Modified flag for noisy LArCells not associated to a cluster but some information in LCE column: up to now, only cells with <E> (green number) above 5GeV was proposed.  This cut is lowered 3 GeV.
