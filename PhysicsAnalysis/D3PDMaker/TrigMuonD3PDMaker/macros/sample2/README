How to use:
	First please setup your athena environment, because
	this sample uses TMNUtile in 
	Trigger/TrigAnalysis/TriggerMenuNtuple.
	It is also recommended to check out latest tag of
	this package.
	Copy this directory to your working directory
        on your cern afs machine. Then with ROOT environment, run
	$ ./init.sh
	$ root -l -b -q run.cc
	This will create `output.root' which contains histograms
	of muFast pt, both for passing and not passing the L2_mu10
	hypo.
