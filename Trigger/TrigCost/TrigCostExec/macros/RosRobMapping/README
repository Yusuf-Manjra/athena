produce a ROS-ROB configuration from an ATLAS partition file

0) download ATLAS partition file from OKS archive
   http://atlas-project-tdaq-cc.web.cern.ch/atlas-project-tdaq-cc/cgi/oks-archive.pl
   and unpack it
   (see also https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/TDAQPoint1RemoteMonitoring for information
    and the "README-download-oks-file" in this directory)

1) setup the TDAQ environment.
   An example can be found in "setup-tdaq.sh" in this directory and setup with "source setup-tdaq.sh" for bash.

2) <path to script>/xml-ros-rob-config.py  partition file <xml Ros Rob mapping output file>    
   -> produce ros-rob mapping file (default name "ros-rob.xml")
   Caution keep the downloaded partition file and schema file in the same directory !
