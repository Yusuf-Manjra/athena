  /* setup a FlowNetwork. This consists of a sink, a source, and alternating
     layers of nodes representing conditions and job groups. Nodes in the same
     layer are at the same distance from the source.
     leaf nodes are the last nodes before the sink. The job group layer
     above them consists of "external products" of the job groups
     satisfying the conditions layer below them. The exxternal product is
     sound by asking the parent node (above the currenrt job group layer)
     which children it is connected to. The job groups from the children
     are collected. All combinations of job groups, taking one per child,
     are merged into a single job group, and then passed to the parent,
     which decides whether or not it ia a satisfying job group. If there
     is satisfaction edges of the approoriate capacity  are established 
     between the parent and its children. The job group satisfiying the parent
     is noted. The process is iterated until the "first generation" 
     conditions are reached. If these are satisfied, they are connected to 
     the sink.
