/**
 * @class CaloGPUHybridClusterProcessor
 * @author Nuno Fernandes <nuno.dos.santos.fernandes@cern.ch>
 * @date 27 May 2022
 * @brief Algorithm to reconstruct CaloCluster objects with GPU acceleration,
 * providing interoperability for calling standard CPU algorithms before and after
 * the GPU processing part.
 *
 * This class is meant as a replacement for @c CaloClusterMaker in that
 * it creates a CaloClusterCollection and runs several tools over it.
 * The main addition is the fact that, besides CPU-based tools,
 * GPU-accelerated versions of the standard tools can be run,
 * with adequate memory sharing between them to minimize transfers
 * and (re-)conversions from and to the GPU-friendly data representation.  */
