 * @brief Hold overloaded store/particle pointer.

 * When we initialize a HepMcParticleLink, we need to save a reference
 * to the current event store.  We use this to look up the particle container
 * when the link is dereferenced.  After that, we no longer need
 * the store pointer.  So to save space, we overload a single pointer
 * to store both of them.  We distinguish the two by setting the low bit
 * if an IProxyDict* is stored.  We allow the value to be atomically
 * changed from an IProxyDict* to a GenParticle*.  This is safe to do
 * concurrently as long as we always get the same GenParticle*.
