# Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I generate events with Powheg in Athena?**

  - Use `Gen_tf` as explained
    [here](powheg_for_atlas#Generating_events_with_Powheg_OT)

**How do I stop my parton shower from running out of events?**

If you're seeing lines like this in your log file

```
17:11:52 PYTHIA Abort from Pythia::next: reached end of Les Houches Events File...
```

then you've run out of LHE events before enough events have passed your
generator filter and been written to your EVNT file. You can increase
the number of events generated by Powheg by adding a line like

```py
PowhegConfig.nEvents *= 1.2
```

to your jobOptions. This particular example will ask PowhegBox to
generate an additional 20% more events on top of how many are already
requested (the default number if nothing is specified would be 10% more
than requested in the `Generate_tf` parameters). Adjust this value as
appropriate for your needs - typically you will want to use `1.0 /
filter_efficiency` with an extra buffer to account for the fact that the
actual filter efficiency will be different from run-to-run.

**How do I run with additional event weights?**

  - See [here](powheg_for_atlas#Running_with_multiple_scale_PDF) for
    PDF/scale weights and
    [here](powheg_for_atlas#Running_with_multiple_non_scale) for other
    weights.

**How do I request support for a new process?**

  - Make a JIRA request as explained
    [here](powheg_for_atlas#Requesting_new_processes)

**Where are the user-configurable options listed?**

  - If you run jobOptions that include the Powheg process that you're
    interested in, you'll see these at the top of the log file
    (`log.generate`). See
    [here](powheg_for_atlas#Changing_parameters_in_the_jobOp) for more
    details.

**How long will generation typically take?**

  - Typical times for interactive lxplus runs are shown
    [here](powheg_for_atlas#Approximate_generation_time)

**How can I speed up long-running processes?**

The first thing to do here is to check what's taking the time. Look for
lines like this in your log file

```terminal
22:11:20 Py:PowhegControl INFO Running nominal Powheg took 0h 06m 06s for 1100 events => 3.0024 Hz ...
03:37:45 Py:PowhegControl INFO Running Powheg afterburners took 5h 26m 25s
```

This will tell you how much time is being spent on generating events and
how much time is taken by calculating additional weights (if
applicable). If most of the time is taken in event generation, then
re-use of integration grids is explained [here](powheg_for_atlas#Re_using_integration_files)

**How can I generate integration grids for a long-running process?**

  - Check
    [here](powheg_for_atlas#Generating_integration_grids)

**How can I tell whether the integration grids are being loaded?**

  - Check `log.generate` for the appropriate lines listed in the table
    [here](powheg_for_atlas#Re_using_integration_files)

**Which SVN release of the POWHEG-BOX process am I using?**

  TODO update!

  - Setup the release as usual with `asetup $my_athena_version`
  - Find the version of `External/Powheg` by running `cmt show versions
    External/Powheg`
  - Look up the SVN release of the POWHEG-BOX process in the table
    linked from [here](powheg_for_atlas#External_Powheg)

**How do I enable generator-level multiple event weights?**

  - For renormalisation/factorisation scale changes or PDF reweighting,
    see [this section](powheg_for_atlas#Running_with_multiple_scale_PDF)
  - For other weights such as NNLOPS/DYNNLO, `hdamp` or other parameter
    changes, see [this
    section](powheg_for_atlas#Running_with_multiple_non_scale)

**Which processes have MiNLO enabled?**

  - See the list [here](powheg_for_atlas#Multi_scale_improved_NLO)



# Introduction

This page gives an introduction to the Monte Carlo (MC) generator
collection POWHEG-BOX. POWHEG (Positive Weight Hardest Emission
Generator) is a method to generate MC events that is accurate at the
next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD which can be interfaced to various
different parton-shower Monte Carlo programs, such as
[Herwig](HerwigForAtlas), [Jimmy](JimmyForAtlas) and
[Pythia](PythiaForAtlas), in such a way that both the leading
logarithmic accuracy of the shower and the NLO accuracy are maintained
in the output. MC generators based on the POWHEG method are thus
alternatives to generators like [MC@NLO](MCatNLOForAtlas) generator.
POWHEG-BOX can be run within Athena by using the `PowhegControl`
package. The GenEvent HepMC output is put into Atlas.StoreGate and may
be used by other packages (e.g full simulation, Atlfast, Rivet...) in
the usual way.

Please bear in mind that some processes can take a very long time to
run. See [here](PowhegForATLAS#Generators_PowhegControl) for more details.

## Powheg in Athena: PowhegControl

PowhegControl is a convenient interface to a series of
different POWHEG-BOX processes which allows easy event generation using
the standard ATLAS generation scripts.

Two packages are needed to run Powheg within Athena: a steering package
(`Generators/PowhegControl`) and a wrapper package for calling the
external POWHEG-BOX process (`External/Powheg`). These are both present
in the 19.X series (currently being used for MC15 production) as well as
in the 17.2.X series (currently being used for MC12 production).

  - [PowhegControl master (21.6 release branch) on
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/tree/21.6/Generators/PowhegControl)
  - [Powheg trunk in
    SVN](https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/atlasoff/browser/External/Powheg/trunk)

Further details about these packages are available in the following
sections:
[Generators/PowhegControl](powheg_for_atlas#Generators_PowhegControl) and
[External/Powheg](powheg_for_atlas#External_Powheg).

## Recommended releases

PowhegControl is available in most recent Athena releases (a full list is
[here](http://atlas-project-mc-production.web.cern.ch/atlas-project-mc-production/Generators/AtlasProduction)).
The recommendation is always to use the most recent release (unless
specifically noted otherwise). Currently this means


| Release series | External/Powheg Tag | Generators/PowhegControl Tag | First release with these tags | Known issues |
| :------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------------: | ----------------------------: | :----------- |
|      r19       |   Powheg-00-03-10   |    PowhegControl-00-03-00    |                     19.2.5.26 | None         |
|      r17       |   Powheg-00-02-07   |    PowhegControl-00-02-17    |                    17.2.14.14 | None         |


See [this section](powheg_for_atlas#External_Powheg) for the corresponding
installation for each tag.

# PowhegControl interface: more details

## External/Powheg

Currently, only some of the processes available in POWHEG-BOX have been
implemented in the on-the-fly Athena package. Processes are installed on
afs and migrated to cvmfs, so they should be available to anyone setting
up Athena in the standard way. It is often useful to know the specific
version of a PowhegControl process that was used to generate a particular
dataset (for example, for correct citation in a paper). Currently a
mixture of POWHEG-BOX V1, POWHEG-BOX V2 and POWHEG-BOX-RES processes are
used - migration to V2 is dependent on the process authors updating
their code, so if you need V2 features (such as PDF reweighting) in a V1
process, a request might need to be made to the process authors.

**POWHEG-BOX SVN revisions for the processes used in each
`External/Powheg` tag are listed [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16XvI5k2I2On4TkkIWJC9MXr0fMaRU2SvOkgBucRPzs0)
in a Google doc.**

Use of older versions is **NOT** recommended, but they are included in
the spreadsheet above so that samples generated with these tags can be
documented.

Please note that release 19 versions are compiled against
LHAPDF version 6, while release 17 versions
are compiled against LHAPDF version 5. Also be aware of this list
of known bugs in particular POWHEG-BOX releases:
<http://powhegbox.mib.infn.it/release_bugs_V2.txt>

## Generators/PowhegControl

The currently installed processes are listed
[here](powheg_for_atlas#List_of_supported_processes_and), together with
the first available Athena release with that process included. For
consistency, the names of some processes in Athena are **different**
from the names of the underlying POWHEG-BOX module; please see the table
for detail.

The best release to use is whatever is used in the current round of MC
production: see [this section](powheg_for_atlas#Recommended_releases) for
more details

# Generating events with PowhegControl

If you are using a reasonably new release, both
`Generators/PowhegControl` and `External/Powheg` will already be
included. If you want to use a different version of either of these
packages than the one in your release, or if you want to run in a
release for which these packages are not already present, you will need
to check out the packages as detailed
[here](powheg_for_atlas#Using_a_specific_tag_or_the_trun)

## Validation and approximate generation time

Using the default settings, the **approximate** time taken to generate
5000 events (including the integration, event generation and
hadronisation steps) is given below. As described in
[PowhegForATLAS#Re_using_integration_files](powheg_for_atlas#Re_using_integration_files),
the integration step can be skipped by re-using the integration grids.
If the integration step is takes longer than **3 hours** to run this
should be considered. If this step takes longer than **6 hours** it
might become mandatory in future to re-use the integration files in
production. Anything that takes longer than **24 hours** may well be
impossible to run in production without re-use of the integration grids.

Before generating events, POWHEG-BOX performs an integration over a
multi-dimensional parameter space. This can be quite slow and so the
integration parameters must be chosen in order to get a balance between
speed and precision. The values used in `PowhegControl` have been chosen
in line with the following guidelines recommended by the POWHEG-BOX
authors.


| Test description          | Requirement                  |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| Cross section uncertainty | \< 1% of total cross section |
| Negative weight events    | \< 1% of events              |
| Upper bound failures      | \< 1% of events              |


Wherever possible, we choose default settings that will pass all of
these tests. The tests are automatically performed by PowhegControl, so
in the `log.generate` file produced when running the jobOptions you will
see output like

```terminal
Py:PowhegControl INFO Integration test :: cross-section uncertainty : 0.30%
19:25:39 Py:PowhegControl INFO Integration test :: negative weight fraction : 0.52%
19:25:39 Py:PowhegControl INFO Integration test :: upper bound violations : 0.82%
19:25:39 Py:PowhegControl INFO -> in inclusive cross-section : 0.82%
19:25:39 Py:PowhegControl INFO -> in generation of radiation : 0.00%
```

In the table below, you can see the results of each of these tests for
each supported process. In each case, if the test result is less than 1%
this is indicated by a :white_check_mark:, if it's between 1% and 10%
then it's preceded by a :exclamation:, while those greater than 10%
are preceded by a :bangbang:. If you generate events with
processes where any of the tests have failed, you should check carefully
whether the events that pass your analysis selection give physical
(non-zero) results in a variety of sensible observables.

## Athena jobOptions using PowhegControl

The POWHEG-BOX executables need to receive a runcard which specifies
various parameters and options. Default parameters are already set for
all the variables associated with each process, and these are
automatically set by including the relevant
`PowhegControl_MyProcess_Common.py` file. Each process can all be
accessed by changing the `MyProcess` in the jobOption include to the
name of the desired process. Example job options are available in
`Generators/PowhegControl/examples`. Here is an example for the
production of WZ events through the PowhegControl interface.

```py
include('PowhegControl/PowhegControl_WZ_Common.py')
PowhegConfig.generate()

include('MC15JobOptions/Pythia8_A14_NNPDF23LO_EvtGen_Common.py')
include('MC15JobOptions/Pythia8_Powheg.py')

evgenConfig.description = 'POWHEG+Pythia8 bb production with A14 NNPDF2.3 tune'
evgenConfig.keywords = ['SM', 'diboson', 'W', 'Z']
evgenConfig.contact = ['<daniel.hayden@cern.ch>']
evgenConfig.minevents = 10
```

## Changing parameters in the jobOptions using PowhegConfig

POWHEG-BOX processes have many parameters which can be changed from the
job options. In order to standardise the interface across processes, the
syntax for these commands has been changed slightly from what can be
found in the relevant POWHEG-BOX manual. A list of user-configurable
command is printed at the top of the `log.generate` file produced when
running PowhegControl jobOptions.

For example, to require $`W^+ Z \to \mu^+ \nu e^+ e^-`$ in the WZ production
process described, you would add

```py
PowhegConfig.decay_mode = 'WpZmuvee'
```

giving an overall set of jobOptions like this:


```py
include('PowhegControl/PowhegControl_WZ_Common.py')
PowhegConfig.decay_mode = 'WpZmuvee' PowhegConfig.generate()

include('MC15JobOptions/Pythia8_A14_NNPDF23LO_EvtGen_Common.py')
include('MC15JobOptions/Pythia8_Powheg.py')

evgenConfig.description = 'POWHEG+Pythia8 bb production with A14 NNPDF2.3 tune'
evgenConfig.keywords = ['SM', 'diboson', 'W', 'Z']
evgenConfig.contact = ['<daniel.hayden@cern.ch>']
evgenConfig.minevents = 10
```

As the runcard for POWHEG-BOX is generated when the job options are run,
commands like this **MUST** be placed before the call to
`PowhegConfig.generate()`, or they will be ignored in favour of the
default settings.

Processes are only added by request, so please get in touch if you're
interested. One of the most time consuming steps in validating a new
process is finding optimal integration parameters (see
[here](PowhegForATLAS#POWHEG_BOX_integration_parameter) for more details).
If you are interested in helping us find optimal integration parameters,
please let us know!


# Advanced event generation

There are several options in POWHEG-BOX generation which can have
complicated effects - sometimes even rendering the output events
theoretically invalid. The defaults set in the `PowhegControl` package
should be correct for the majority of users, but it is possible for
advanced users to change them.

## POWHEG-BOX integration parameters

As discussed earlier, POWHEG-BOX performs an integration over a
multi-dimensional parameter space before generating events. The
parameters used for this integration must be tuned to get the best
generation speed while remaining adequately precise. The values used in
`PowhegControl` have been chosen in line with the following guidelines
recommended by the POWHEG-BOX authors.

| Test description                    | Requirement                  | How to reduce if this is too high                   |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Cross section uncertainty           | \< 1% of total cross section | increase `ncall1`, `itmx1`, `ncall2` and/or `itmx2` |
| Negative weight events              | \< 1% of events              | increase `foldx`, `foldy` and/or `foldphi`          |
| Upper bound failures: cross-section | \< 1% of events              | increase `ncall2`                                   |
| Upper bound failures: radiation     | \< 1% of events              | increase `nubound`, `xupbound`, `icsimax`, `iymax`  |

The output of these tests is reported in the `log.generate` file
produced when running the jobOptions. You will see output like

```terminal
Py:PowhegControl INFO Integration test :: cross-section uncertainty : 0.26%
00:52:07 Py:PowhegControl INFO Integration test :: negative weight fraction : 0.77%
00:52:07 Py:PowhegControl INFO Integration test :: upper bound violations : 0.90%
```

If any of the integration tests have failed, the INFO messages will be
WARNING messages, and you should increase the appropriate integration
parameters. In particular, changes to any of the following parameters
will invalidate the checks made in `PowhegControl` validation:
`bornktmin`, `bornsuppfact`, `foldx`, `foldy`, `foldphi`, `itmx1`,
`itmx2`, `ncall1`, `ncall2`, `nubound`, `xupbound`. In addition, changes
to the phase space under consideration (for example changing pT cuts or
masses of particles) can also invalidate these checks.

If you make any changes from the defaults for a particular process,
**YOU** are responsible for ensuring that the output passes these tests.

A more detailed automated testing suite for trying out and testing
different parameters is here:
<https://svnweb.cern.ch/cern/wsvn/atlas-jrobinso/PowhegAutomator/trunk/>;
please get in touch with Stefan Richter (<stefan.richter@cern.ch>) to
find out how to use this if you want to test several parameter sets.

TODO update PowhegAutomator reference above!

An example where this has been done and documented is here:
<https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/DMProductionRun2#MC15_pilot_request>

## Generating integration grids

The easiest way to generate and test grids for long-running jobs is to
run on a batch system. A convenience script
(PowhegIntegrationGridGenerator) for doing this is available
[here](https://svnweb.cern.ch/cern/wsvn/atlas-jrobinso/PowhegIntegrationGridGenerator).
Please use the latest tag (currently
PowhegIntegrationGridGenerator-00-01-05). Instructions are contained in
the package.

TODO update PowhegIntegrationGridGenerator reference above!

## Event weights: Born-level suppression and negative weights

Despite the name, POWHEG does generate negative weight events. The
default in ATLAS before `PowhegControl-00-02-09` was to reject these,
but now they are accepted by default in all processes. Allowing negative
weights can, in some cases, allow unphysical negative numbers of events
in poorly understood areas of phase space. Additionally, if the
`bornsuppfact` parameter is used to enable Born-level suppression,
`Powheg` will generate weighted events for which the average weight is
equal to the cross-section of the process in question. This can lead to
**very** large event weights in the case of events which have a
particularly low transverse momenta at the Born level, and then pick up
hard jets from the parton shower.

| Born-level suppression by default     | Negative weights by default | No weighting by default |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `jjj`, `ssWWjj`, `ttj`, `Wbbj`, `Wbb` | All processes               | None                    |


If either Born-level suppression or negative weights are used (which is
the case for all processes by default) then the cross-section reported
by POWHEG-BOX will be incorrect. Please use the one printed by
PowhegControl in the log file instead. See the caveats here:
NegativeWeightPowheg

## Saving LHE files

By default, only the output EVNT files will be saved at the end of a
production run, but if the `--outputTXTFile` option of `Generate_tf.py`
is used then the LHE files will also be saved into whatever container
name is specified by this option.

## Using a specific tag (or the trunk) of PowhegControl

To use a specific tag of PowhegControl, you will need to check out the
code from SVN and compile it. The following example (in a **clean**
directory) will check

TODO update above to Git!

```bash
asetup 19.2.5.30,here # or whichever athena version you prefer
cmt co -r PowhegControl-00-03-00 Generators/PowhegControl # or use HEAD as the version to get the trunk
setupWorkArea.py
cd WorkArea/cmt
cmt br "cmt config; make"
```

TODO update above to Git/Release 21!

If you need a specific version of External/Powheg (unlikely) then you
can check that out too.

## Re-using integration files

If the integration step (before events are generated) is lengthy, the
integration step can be skipped by re-using the Powheg integration
grids. Please note that there are usually three or four steps in PowhegControl
event generation:

- Powheg integration
- Powheg event generation
- Athena-based event hadronisation (eg. with PYTHIA or HERWIG)
- (optional) event filtering.

By re-using the Powheg integration grids only the first of these steps
can be skipped. The following files (produced during a local run) are
needed:

| Generation stage |               V1 jobs                |               V2 jobs                |               RES jobs               |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
|        1         |  `pwgxgrid.dat`, `pwggridinfo*.dat`  |  `pwg*xg*.dat`, `pwggridinfo*.dat`   |           `pwg*xgrid*.dat`           |
|        2         |    `pwg*upb*.dat`, `pwggrid*.dat`    |    `pwg*upb*.dat`, `pwggrid*.dat`    |    `pwg*upb*.dat`, `pwggrid*.dat`    |
|        3         | `pwgfullgrid*.dat`, `pwgubound*.dat` | `pwgfullgrid*.dat`, `pwgubound*.dat` | `pwgfullgrid*.dat`, `pwgubound*.dat` |


For local running/testing it is sufficient that they are in the local
working directory. For production both files should be put into a tar
file using the following command:

```bash
group.phys-gener.powheg_<version>.<RunNumber>.<ProcessDescription>_<CoMEnergy>.TXT.<CampaignName>_v1._00001.tar.gz <FileList>
```

where `version` is the External/Powheg version, `RunNumber` is the
intended run number and `ProcessDescription` a short process
description, similar to the physics short description of the JO name.
Please update the centre of mass energy and the campaign name (eg.
`mc15`) accordingly. This tar ball needs to be uploaded to the grid.

An automated generator for these integration grids, which takes Powheg
OTF jobOptions as input and provides an integration grid tarball as
output is here:
<https://svnweb.cern.ch/cern/wsvn/atlas-jrobinso/PowhegIntegrationGridGenerator/tags/>.
Please use the latest tag (currently
`PowhegIntegrationGridGenerator-00-01-04/`). There are instructions on
usage in the README provided with the code.

The integration grid tar ball needs to be passed to `Generate_tf.py` via
the `inputGenConfFile` argument. Contact your group production contact
for details and help. Most details given at
AtlasProtected.PreparingLesHouchesEven also apply for integration grids,
although only one file is needed here.

Please check that the use of integration grids give a significant speed
up. Sometimes most time is spend in the athena based hadronisation
process, especially if low efficiency filters are used. For example,
plain ttbar or single gauge boson processes do not need pre-made
integration grids.

Please note that integration grids generated in either single-core or
multi-core mode can be re-used. However, **if integration files are
provided as input to a multi-core generation job, they will not be
used** - only single core
Powheg makes the appropriate check for existing integration grids.

TODO is the previous sentence still true?

## Running in multicore mode

It is possible to run POWHEG-BOX in multicore mode which can speed up
event generation by parallelising the event generation. In order to
enable this, simple set the following environment variable

`ATHENA_PROC_NUMBER`

to the desired number of cores to use.
**Running event generation in
multicore mode ignores any integration files that are provided by the
user.**
