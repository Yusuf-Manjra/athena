The TrkAmbiguityProcessor is responsible for resolving ambiguities in the passed TrackCollection. To do this, it attempts to improve the 'score' of an event, where the score of an event is the summed scores of all the tracks it contains. To this end, there is a (currently simplistic) Trk::TrackScoringTool, as well as a Trk::ITrackScoringHelperTool interface (to allow for ID and muon-specific implementation, without introducing a dependency). Additionally, the TrkAmbiguityProcessor makes use of a Trk::PRD_AssociationTool which keeps track of all the Trk::PrepRawData on the tracks, and knows which are shared with which Trk::Track etc.

There are two algtools provided:
   - SimpleAmbiguityProcessorTool
   - TrackAmbiguityProcessorTool
   
Currently only SimpleAmbiguityProcessorTool works - any use of TrackAmbiguityProcessorTool will produce WARNING messages (and broken ambiguity resolution).
