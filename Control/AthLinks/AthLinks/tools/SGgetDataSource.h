/**
 * @file  AthLinks/tools/SGgetDataSource.h
 * @author scott snyder, Paolo Calafiura
 * @date Feb 2004
 * @brief Provide an interface for obtaining the `current' data store.
 *
 * When a @c DataProxyStorage is constructed, it needs to know the
 * data source (an @c IProxyDictWithPool implementation) in which it should
 * look to satisfy the reference.  This can be specified as a parameter
 * to the constructor, but more often, it is defaulted, meaning to use
 * the `current' data store.  The functions here define that notion.
 *
 * The entry point is @c getDataSourcePointer.  This takes as a parameter
 * the name of the data source (usually ``StoreGateSvc''), and returns
 * a pointer to a pointer to the data source.
 *
 * It is possible for the store to change.
 * In this case, the pointer (to the store pointer) returned by
 * @c getDataSourcePointer will stay the same, but the contents
 * of the pointer pointed to will change.  This allows one to safely
 * cache the pointer (to pointer) in static storage.
 *
 * By default, the store is found by looking for a Gaudi service
 * with the specified name.  This behavior may be changed by assigning
 * an alternate function to @c getDataSourcePointerFunc.
