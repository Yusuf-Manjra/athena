# ONNXRUNTIME for VVJJ
This has been deveoped starting from the ONNXRUNTIME Example Package in Athena

This package is meant to hold code needed for the new DisCoJet boson tagger;
in particular the building of jet images and the loading of a CNN and a DNN model is performed by the code.
All the pieces are relevant for the SmoothedWZDisCoJetTagger tool but they can be re-used or extended in future
for other taggers.
