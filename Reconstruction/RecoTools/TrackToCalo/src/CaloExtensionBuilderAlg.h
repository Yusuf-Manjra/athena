  /** 
  This algorithm creates a calo extension collection and stores it in a Gaudi Gate named "ParticleCaloExtension" to be read by other algorithms.
  Clients who want to use the stored extensions should know that the Trk::IParticleCaloExtensionTool's function caloExtension(*track) returns a unique pointer where as the stored extensions come from
  a CaloExtensionCollection which is a vector of Trk::CaloExtension pointers. 
  In order to have access to these extrapolations and have the ability to calculate extrapolations in case they are not stored in the gate one needs to do the following:
  The original calo extension object should be renamed to denote that it holds an unique pointer and will act as a helper pointer (this is important)
  After creating a read handle, one can access the correct Trk::CaloExtension * objects from the CaloExtensionCollection via the xAOD::TrackParticle's index() method.
  The CaloExtensionCollection is indexed the same way as the xAOD::TrackParticleContainer so if the client has a derived track class that changes the index, it is important to get 
  the index from the original xAOD::TrackParticle rather than the derived class.
  
  For usage and compatibility, one should do the same as is done in TauElectronVetoVariables.cxx, TauTrackFinder.cxx, or eflowTrackCaloExtensionTool.cxx. 
  In short, the following will work for tracks that are extrapolated:
  `extension = (*particleCache)[index];`
  In the case that the desired extension is not extrapolated by this algorithm, the following needs to be done:
  `uniqueExtension = theTrackExtrapolatorTool->caloExtension(*track);` 
  `extension = uniqueExtension.get();`
  One should avoid the use of `extension = theTrackExtrapolatorTool->caloExtension(*track).get();` as it has unpredictable behavior.
